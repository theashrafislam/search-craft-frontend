# Product Search Frontend

This project is a frontend web application built with React.js that allows users to search, filter, sort, and paginate through a list of products. The application interacts with a backend API to fetch and display product data.

## Features

- **Search Products:** Search for products by name using a search bar.
- **Filter Products:** Filter products by category, brand, and price range.
- **Sort Products:** Sort products by price (ascending or descending) and by newest first.
- **Pagination:** Navigate through pages of products.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.x or higher)
- npm or yarn
